# JavaScript Math Object Mastery

## Part 1: Theory Questions

### What is the Math object in JavaScript?
The Math object in JavaScript is a built-in object that provides mathematical constants and functions, such as rounding, trigonometric calculations, exponentiation, and random number generation. It is not a constructor and is used directly.

### Is it a constructor (i.e., can you create an instance with new Math())?
→ No, Math is not a constructor. You cannot use new Math(). Instead, you use it as a static object, like Math.round(5.5).

### Explain the difference between:

- **Math.round()** → Rounds a number to the nearest integer. If the decimal is 0.5 or higher, it rounds up; otherwise, it rounds down.
- **Math.ceil()** → Rounds a number up to the next largest integer, regardless of the decimal.
- **Math.floor()** → Rounds a number down to the next smallest integer, regardless of the decimal.

### How does Math.random() work?
Math.random() generates a pseudo-random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), such as 0.472 or 0.999.

### What is the range of values it can produce?
→ It produces values in the range:  
0 ≤ value < 1
